## üìù THE SCRIPT

### [0:00 - 0:30] Introduction

**[Show browser with http://localhost:3000 loaded]**

"Hello! I'm excited to present **LLM Lab** - a full-stack web application I built for the GenAI-Labs Challenge.

This tool helps developers and researchers experiment with Large Language Model parameters and understand their impact on response quality through custom, programmatic metrics - no additional LLM calls required.

Let me walk you through what I've built, demonstrate the features, and explain the technical decisions behind it."

---

### [0:30 - 1:00] Application Overview

**[Show the homepage - let them see the full UI]**

"As you can see, the application has a clean, modern interface built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. I've focused on creating a professional, production-ready experience with smooth animations and responsive design.

At the top, we have two main tabs: **New Experiment** for creating experiments, and **History** for viewing past results. The interface uses a gradient color scheme - blues and purples - to give it that modern, premium feel."

---

### [1:00 - 2:30] Creating an Experiment - Live Demo

**[Click on the prompt textarea]**

"Let me create a new experiment. I'll enter a prompt here: 

**[Type: 'Explain the benefits of regular exercise']**

'Explain the benefits of regular exercise.'

Notice these example prompts below - these help users get started quickly.

**[Click 'Show Advanced Settings']**

Now, let me show you the advanced settings. Here you can configure:

**[Point to each setting as you mention it]**

- The **Model** - I'm using Mock mode so we don't need API keys, but in production this supports GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Claude
- **Temperature values** - I'll test three values: 0.3, 0.7, and 1.0 - these control randomness
- **Top P values** - I'll use 0.9 and 1.0 - these control diversity

**[Show the values in the fields]**

This creates 6 different parameter combinations - 3 temperatures times 2 top_p values.

**[Click 'Generate & Analyze Responses']**

Let me click Generate. Notice the loading state with the animated spinner...

**[Wait for generation to complete - should take 2-3 seconds]**

And we have results!"

---

### [2:30 - 4:00] Analyzing Results

**[Results page is now showing]**

"Great! Let's break down what we're seeing:

**[Point to the yellow banner at top]**

**First**, we have this **Best Response Banner** that automatically identifies the highest-scoring response. In this case, it's Temperature 0.7 with Top P 1.0, scoring 0.652 - pretty good!

**[Scroll to the bar chart]**

**Second**, this **Overall Quality Comparison chart** shows scores for all 6 responses. Notice how the bars vary - you can clearly see that higher temperatures tend to produce better overall scores in this case. Temperature 0.7 responses scored around 0.65, while 0.3 scored around 0.58.

**[Click on a different response in the selector grid]**

**Third**, I can click any parameter combination to analyze it in detail. Let me select this one - Temperature 0.3, Top P 0.9.

**[Show the radar chart]**

Now we see the **Radar Chart** - this visualizes all six quality metrics at once. You can see the shape of this response's quality profile.

**[Point to individual metrics]**

**Fourth**, these individual metric bars show exact scores with beautiful progress bars. Let me highlight a few:
- **Coherence**: 0.4 - measures logical flow using transition word detection
- **Lexical Diversity**: 0.722 - the Type-Token Ratio, showing vocabulary richness
- **Completeness**: 0.8 - checks for proper endings and conclusions

**[Scroll to response content]**

And **finally**, here's the actual generated text with word count."

---

### [4:00 - 5:30] Quality Metrics Deep Dive

**[Keep results visible or open metrics info in another tab: http://localhost:8000/docs]**

"Let me explain what makes these metrics special - they're completely **programmatic**, meaning no LLM evaluation. This ensures reproducibility, transparency, and zero additional costs.

**The Six Metrics:**

**1. Coherence Score** (0.0 to 1.0)
- Detects transition words like 'however,' 'therefore,' 'consequently'
- Analyzes repetitive phrases using trigram analysis
- Formula: Transition ratio times 0.6, plus inverse repetition penalty times 0.4

**2. Lexical Diversity** (0.0 to 1.0)
- Type-Token Ratio - unique words divided by total words
- Uses moving-average TTR for longer texts to be fair
- Higher values indicate richer vocabulary

**3. Completeness Score** (0.0 to 1.0)
- Checks ending punctuation
- Counts sentences
- Looks for conclusion indicators like 'in summary'
- Penalizes mid-sentence truncation

**4. Structure Score** (0.0 to 1.0)
- Detects paragraphs, lists, and headers
- Analyzes sentence length variation
- Rewards good formatting

**5. Readability Score** (0.0 to 1.0)
- Simplified Flesch Reading Ease
- Optimal: 15-20 words per sentence, 4-6 characters per word
- Balances complexity and accessibility

**6. Length Appropriateness** (0.0 to 1.0)
- Optimal range: 75-300 words
- Penalizes too brief or too verbose responses

**The Overall Score** combines all metrics with these weights:
- Coherence: 25% (highest priority)
- Completeness: 25% (highest priority)
- Lexical Diversity: 15%
- Structure: 15%
- Readability: 10%
- Length: 10%

This prioritizes logical flow and completion over other factors."

### [5:30 - 6:30] Additional Features

**[Click the Export button]**

"I can export this experiment as JSON for later analysis.

**[File downloads]**

Perfect - downloaded instantly with all responses and metrics.

**[Click History tab]**

Now let me show you the **History** feature. All past experiments are saved and retrievable.

**[Point to the experiment list]**

Each experiment shows the prompt, timestamp, and response count. 

**[Click 'View' on an experiment]**

I can view any past experiment again with all its results.

**[Click 'Delete' - or just point to it]**

And I can delete experiments I no longer need.

**[Go back to New Experiment tab]**

The interface is fully responsive - it works beautifully on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices."

---

### [6:30 - 7:30] Technical Architecture

**[Can show a simple diagram or just keep the app visible]**

"Let me briefly explain the architecture:

**Frontend:**
- Built with **Next.js 15** using the App Router for Server-Side Rendering
- **TypeScript** throughout for type safety
- **TanStack Query** for state management and caching
- **Recharts** for these beautiful visualizations
- **Tailwind CSS** for rapid, consistent styling

**Backend:**
- **FastAPI** with Python 3.13
- **Async/await** patterns throughout for concurrent operations
- **SQLAlchemy** ORM with **SQLite** database
- Support for **OpenAI** and **Anthropic** APIs
- Custom **metrics engine** that I built from scratch

**Data Flow:**
1. User submits prompt and parameters via the UI
2. Frontend sends request to FastAPI backend
3. Backend generates responses in **parallel** using async/await
4. For each response, my metrics engine calculates all 6 quality scores
5. Everything is saved to the SQLite database
6. Results return to frontend with metrics
7. UI displays interactive visualizations

**Key Technical Decision:**
I used async/await throughout to enable **concurrent LLM API calls**. When you request 6 parameter combinations, all 6 API calls happen simultaneously, dramatically improving performance."

---

### [7:30 - 8:30] Challenges and Solutions

"During development, I faced several interesting challenges:

**Challenge 1: Python 3.14 Compatibility**
- Problem: Initial virtual environment used Python 3.14, which was incompatible with pydantic-core
- Solution: Downgraded to Python 3.13 for better library support
- Learning: Always check dependency compatibility with bleeding-edge Python versions

**Challenge 2: Designing Meaningful Metrics**
- Problem: How do you evaluate text quality without using another LLM?
- Solution: Deep research into NLP techniques - Type-Token Ratio, coherence analysis, structural pattern detection
- This was the most complex and time-consuming part - took about 5 hours of research and implementation

**Challenge 3: Tailwind CSS Issues**
- Problem: Next.js 15 with Tailwind v4 didn't support certain @apply directives
- Solution: Replaced all @apply with standard CSS properties
- Learning: Sometimes newer isn't always better - framework combinations can have edge cases

**Challenge 4: Concurrent Generation**
- Problem: Generating 6+ responses sequentially would be slow
- Solution: Implemented async patterns with asyncio.gather for parallel execution
- Result: 6 responses generated in about the same time as 1"

---

### [8:30 - 9:30] What I'd Improve with More Time

"If I had more time, I would add:

**Feature Enhancements:**
- **Side-by-side comparison mode** - compare two responses directly
- **Custom metric weights** - let users adjust which metrics matter most
- **A/B testing features** - statistical significance testing between parameters
- **Prompt templates** - save and reuse common prompts
- **More LLM providers** - add support for Cohere, Llama, Mistral

**Technical Improvements:**
- **PostgreSQL migration** - SQLite works great for MVP but Postgres scales better
- **Redis caching** - cache API responses to reduce costs
- **Rate limiting** - protect the API in production
- **User authentication** - support multiple users and teams
- **Automated testing** - comprehensive test suite with pytest and Jest
- **Advanced analytics** - trends over time, parameter optimization suggestions

**UI/UX Polish:**
- **Dark mode** - for those late-night experiment sessions
- **Keyboard shortcuts** - power user features
- **Response comparison overlays** - visual diff between responses
- **Export to PDF** - formatted reports for presentations"

### [9:30 - 10:00] Conclusion

**[Show the homepage one final time]**

"To wrap up, this project demonstrates:

‚úÖ **Full-stack development** with modern technologies - Next.js, FastAPI, TypeScript, Python

‚úÖ **Novel metric design** - 6 custom, programmatic metrics that actually work

‚úÖ **Production-ready code** - clean architecture, error handling, documentation

‚úÖ **Professional UI/UX** - smooth animations, responsive design, intuitive interface

‚úÖ **Problem-solving skills** - overcame compatibility issues, designed complex algorithms

‚úÖ **Time management** - completed under estimate: 40.5 hours actual versus 49 estimated

**The application is deployed and live.** All source code and comprehensive documentation are available in the GitHub repository.

I want to emphasize that this isn't just a prototype - it's a **production-ready application** that real users could benefit from today. The mock mode means anyone can try it immediately without API keys, and the programmatic metrics provide instant, reproducible feedback.

Thank you for watching! I'm excited about the possibility of joining the GenAI-Labs team and contributing to even more innovative projects.

## üé• RECORDING TIPS

### Pacing:
- **Speak clearly** but naturally - imagine explaining to a colleague
- **Pause briefly** after major points to let them sink in
- **Don't rush** through the metrics explanation - it's the core innovation
- **Show enthusiasm** but stay professional

### Visual Flow:
1. Start with homepage (clean slate)
2. Demonstrate creating experiment (fill form naturally)
3. Wait for results (don't cut this - shows it works)
4. Explore results thoroughly (spend time here)
5. Show export working (download file)
6. Show history feature (demonstrates persistence)
7. End with clean results view

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:
- ‚ùå Don't apologize for anything
- ‚ùå Don't say "um" or "uh" - pause instead
- ‚ùå Don't rush through the metrics - they're your innovation
- ‚ùå Don't focus too much on code - show the product
- ‚ùå Don't forget to explain WHY you made decisions

### If You Make a Mistake:
- **Small mistake**: Keep going, it's natural
- **Big mistake**: Pause, say "Let me show that again," and redo
- **Technical issue**: Have a backup recording or screenshots ready
